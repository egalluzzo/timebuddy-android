Time Buddy for Android
======================

This is an Android client for [Time Buddy](http://code.google.com/p/timebuddy/).  It has pretty much all the features from the desktop client, plus a nice calendar view.

What is Time Buddy?
-------------------

The purpose of Time Buddy is to alleviate the pain and suffering that people go through at the end of every week (or month) trying to figure out exactly what they were doing on Tuesday at 9:30.  Basically, it pesters you every hour to enter a description of what you are doing.  That way, at the end of the week, you can look back over your log and more easily enter an accurate timesheet into the system of your choice.

Disclaimer
----------

Right now, some of the features of the Android client are force-fit into the data model of the server.  So if you look at the time entries you've input via Android in the web app, they may have odd-looking tags and descriptions.  The eventual intent is to rewrite the backend in Rails on Heroku, but I haven't had the time yet.

Does it integrate with my favorite timesheet system?
----------------------------------------------------

No, sorry, not yet, but that is on our radar.

The lovely calendar and main dashboard layout came from the [Google I/O 2011 app](http://code.google.com/p/iosched/).  The color picker came from the Android SDK samples.
